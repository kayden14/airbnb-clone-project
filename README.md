# airbnb-clone-project


Project Overview

This project aims to create a functional clone of the popular Airbnb platform. The goal is to replicate key features such as browsing listings, viewing details, user authentication (simplified for this clone), and potentially booking functionality. This project serves as a learning exercise to practice front-end and potentially back-end development skills, focusing on building a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

Project Goals

User Interface (UI) Replication:** Accurately reproduce the look and feel of the Airbnb website.
Browse Listings:** Implement a system to display various accommodation listings with relevant information (images, descriptions, prices, locations).
Listing Details:** Create a detailed page for each listing, showcasing more information and potentially amenities.
User Authentication (Simplified):** Implement basic user login and registration (may not include full security features in an initial phase).
(Future Goal) Booking Functionality:** Explore the possibility of implementing a simplified booking system.
Responsiveness:** Ensure the website is responsive and works well on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Tech Stack
